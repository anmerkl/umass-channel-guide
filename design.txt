  deletes shows as they are done - no need to go back in time

  find_or_create
  has_many channels

How/when to update channels with showtimes?
  Should there be ability to update manually?
    TBD, but if i hookup the automatic updates correctly, then manual updates should only involve adding a user button
  How far into the future do I give showtimes?
    daily updates that run and populate midnight to midnight?
    ** frequent, minor updates (every few hours) **
